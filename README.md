A web application that visualizes travel times from different locations using interactive, dynamically-adjusted isochrone maps.

## üìã Project Overview

This application helps users understand travel time patterns by visualizing isochrones - areas that can be reached within a specific time from a starting point. Unlike traditional maps that show physical distance, our isochrones represent travel time, providing a more practical view for urban planning, real estate decisions, and everyday travel planning.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Interactive Map Interface** - Pan, zoom, and navigate a fully responsive map
- **POI Management** - Add, edit, and delete points of interest with custom categories
- **Dynamic Travel Time Visualization** - See color-coded areas showing locations reachable within specified timeframes
- **Real-time Updates** - Travel times adjust based on current traffic conditions
- **Location Search** - Find places quickly with integrated search functionality
- **Time-Deformed Maps** - Generate alternative map views where distance represents travel time instead of physical distance
- **Filtering System** - Filter locations by category, travel time, or other attributes

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Leaflet.js
- **Backend:** Python, Flask

## üåê API Integration

This application uses [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org/) for isochrone generation, which provides powerful geospatial analysis capabilities.

## ü§ñ Prompt Engineering Credits

We would like to acknowledge the support provided by Clause Sonnet 3.7 prompt engineering in resolving several critical development challenges:

### Bug Fixing Examples

1. **Authentication Token Expiration Bug**:  
   When users experienced sudden disconnections, Clause Sonnet 3.7 helped identify that the JWT refresh mechanism was failing silently. It guided us in implementing a proper token refresh pattern with appropriate error handling.

2. **Isochrone Rendering Glitch**:  
   We encountered inconsistent polygon rendering for isochrones that crossed the 180¬∞ meridian. Through prompt engineering, we were able to understand the geodata normalization issue and implement the correct polygon splitting technique.

3. **Database Connection Pool Saturation**:  
   Users reported random 500 errors during peak usage. Clause Sonnet 3.7 helped diagnose the connection pooling configuration issues and guided us in implementing a more efficient connection management strategy with proper timeout handling.

### Known Bugs / Documentation Backlog

- **Important reminders**:  
  In practice, it was mostly used for important reminders, sush as files that should not be pushed to remote or
  api credentials updating for every local instance

### Load-Order Refactoring

1. **JavaScript Dependency Circular Reference**:  
   Our map initialization was failing intermittently due to complex module interdependencies. Prompt engineering helped us visualize the dependency graph and restructure our code with a proper initialization sequence pattern.

2. **API Service Initialization Sequence**:  
   The application sometimes failed to properly initialize the geolocation services. Clause Sonnet 3.7 guided us in implementing a promise-based service initialization chain that ensured proper loading order regardless of network response timing.
